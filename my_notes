# App starts with an index page greeting user and asking them to "Log In" or "Create an account".
# Should "create an account" be a link or a button? How do I make 2 buttons work in a single post?
# "Create an account" should render a signup page.
# That signup page should post to a create user action.
# That action should create a user, log them in, and render their new /user/home page.

# "Log In" takes the user to their /user/home page.
# They can "See My List" with a button click or "Add Pins" with a button click. How do I make 2 buttons work?
# "See My List" should render a page with an itemized list of pins.
# "Add Pins" should render an edit.erb page.
